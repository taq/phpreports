# PHPReports

| :warning: **WARNING** This software is [abandonware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abandonware). As the creator and maintainer, I don't even use PHP _for years_, so, I can't support it anymore. It should work ok for PHP untill version 7, but seems that with 8.1 there are some alerts. Feel free to fork it and keep it going. |

PHPReports is an easy way to use PHP and XML to create reports.
The main purpose is see the report on a web browser, but you can run it as
a command line script to make the reports.
